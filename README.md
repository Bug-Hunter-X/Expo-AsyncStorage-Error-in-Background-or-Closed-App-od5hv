# Expo AsyncStorage Background Task Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using AsyncStorage in Expo applications, specifically when the app is running in the background or has been closed.

The problem is that AsyncStorage relies on the app's main thread for operations.  When the app is backgrounded or closed, this thread is no longer available, leading to silent failures or errors when attempting to read or write data.

The `bug.js` file showcases this error, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using alternative storage mechanisms better suited for background tasks and app closure.
