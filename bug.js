This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in Expo and the app is running in the background or is closed.  The `AsyncStorage.setItem` or `AsyncStorage.getItem` functions might fail silently, or throw an error. This is because AsyncStorage relies on the app's main thread to function, which isn't available when the app is not running.

```javascript
// buggy code
AsyncStorage.setItem('myKey', 'myValue');

// ...later, in a background task or after app is closed...
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => {
  console.log(value); // might return null or undefined, or throw an error
});
```
